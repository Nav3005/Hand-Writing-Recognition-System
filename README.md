## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. CNNs are particularly effective in handling image data due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers.

## Features
- Preprocessing of MNIST images for training and evaluation.
- CNN architecture optimized for digit recognition.
- Training and evaluation scripts to measure model performance.
- Visualizations of training progress and model accuracy.

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project downloads and loads the dataset automatically using popular deep learning libraries.

## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this project includes:
- **Convolutional Layers**: To detect features in the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce the dimensionality and retain the most important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: To make predictions based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.

The architecture is designed to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving high accuracy on the MNIST dataset with minimal processing time.
